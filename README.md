# Ultrasonic Sensor Theremin
### I created this theremin for an assignment for my History of Technology in Music class during the Fall 2023 semester
### I was gifted the WeMos D1 R2 microcontroller by my friend who wanted to give me a jumpstart with design and implementation
### I decided to program my theremin in Arduino, because I've always wanted to learn how to use the IDE since high school

### You can find the code the the theremin [*here*](https://github.com/FrancisTanglao/UltrasonicSensorTheremin/blob/main/WeMosUltrasonicSensorTheremin.ino)
## Conversion

### I ran into a lot of problems with this project because I didn't realize that the pinouts for Arduino were for their boards and not cross-compatible with others
